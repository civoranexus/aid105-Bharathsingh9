##  Project: SchemeAssist AI – AID105

### Student Name
Bharath Singh Palthyavath

### Project Description
SchemeAssist AI is an AI-based Government Scheme Recommendation System developed to
help citizens easily identify government schemes they are eligible for based on
their personal profile, eligibility conditions, and location. The main intention
of this project is to reduce the time and confusion involved in searching multiple
government portals by providing clear, personalized, and explainable scheme
recommendations.



### AI Approach
This project uses a **Knowledge-Based AI model** with **rule-based eligibility
scoring**. Since government scheme eligibility rules are clearly defined and
policy-driven, a rule-based and explainable AI approach is more suitable than
complex machine learning models.

The system evaluates user details such as age, income, category, and location,
assigns eligibility scores to each scheme, and ranks the schemes based on how well
they match the user’s profile.



### Live Data Usage
Live government data is used wherever it is practically available. In this project,
live administrative location data is sourced from the **Local Government Directory
(LGD)** to populate and validate user location details like State and District.

Using LGD data helps ensure that:
- Location information is official and up to date
- Scheme filtering is accurate based on user location
- The system behaves similarly to real government portals

Eligibility rules such as age limits and income limits are not available as live
machine-readable data, so they are manually structured using information from
official scheme guidelines.


### User Profile Data (Planned)
To perform eligibility analysis, the system collects basic user information such as:
- Age
- Annual family income
- State and district (selected using live LGD data)
- Category (SC/ST/OBC/General)
- Gender

This information serves as the primary input for the AI recommendation engine.



### Scheme Data (Planned)
Each government scheme is represented using structured data that includes:
- Scheme name and brief description
- Benefits provided by the scheme
- Eligibility criteria in readable form
- Age and income limits
- Applicable level (Central or State)
- Category and gender applicability
- Required documents and application details

This structured representation allows the system to accurately evaluate eligibility
and provide clear explanations for recommendations.



### Current Progress
- Gained a clear understanding of the project objectives and internship guidelines
- Identified the required user profile and scheme-related data
- Understood the use of live and manually structured data
- Finalized the knowledge-based AI approach for eligibility analysis
- Planned the hybrid data integration strategy
